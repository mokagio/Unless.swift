# Unless.swift

> Unless this, do that

Unless.swift is a Âµ-framework, or rather an n-framework, that provide syntactic sugar to write code that reads like "unless this do that".

```swift
unless(condition) { 
  doSomething()
}
```

It's inspired by Ruby's `unless` operator:

```ruby
unless condition do
  do_something
end
```
